# Hi there!

I'm Andrew Ng (he/him), an incoming college student interested in all types of biology, as well as the intersection between science, technology, and social justice! I mostly use GitHub for storing LaTeX files of Scioly tests I've written/am writing in private repos, so there's not much to see here (yet!).
