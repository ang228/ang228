# Hi there!

I am an undergrad at Tufts University majoring in Biochemistry, and a member of the Wattrus Lab in the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Molecular Biology. My research focuses on the molecular mechanisms underpinning spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish, specifically interactions between macrophages and glial cells post-injury.
